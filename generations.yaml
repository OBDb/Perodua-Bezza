    description: "The original Perodua Bezza was a significant milestone as Perodua's first sedan model, designed and developed primarily for the Malaysian market. Built on the platform shared with the Axia hatchback but with a sedan body style, it featured a conservative yet functional design with emphasis on maximizing interior space and fuel efficiency. Powered by either a 1.0L three-cylinder VVT-i engine producing 67 horsepower or a 1.3L four-cylinder Dual VVT-i engine generating 94 horsepower, paired with either a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission. The interior prioritized practical features including multiple storage compartments, flexible seating configurations, and a surprisingly spacious 508-liter trunk with a unique 60:40 split-folding rear bench seatâ€”unusual in its segment. Available features included push-button start, touchscreen infotainment, reverse camera, and Vehicle Stability Control on higher trims. The Bezza achieved 5-star ASEAN NCAP safety ratings with its reinforced structure and safety features including dual airbags, ABS with EBD, and ISOFIX child seat anchors. This first generation positioned the Bezza as an affordable yet well-equipped entry-level sedan focused on value, fuel efficiency, and practicality for urban Malaysian families."

    description: "The refreshed Perodua Bezza received substantial styling updates while maintaining the same fundamental platform and dimensions. Exterior changes included a more modern front fascia with a sportier bumper design, revised grille pattern, reshaped headlights with LED daytime running lights on higher trims, LED headlamps for premium variants, and updated rear styling with new taillight designs. Mechanical specifications remained largely unchanged with the same 1.0L and 1.3L engine options, though with refinements for improved efficiency. The most significant update came in safety technology, with Perodua's Advanced Safety Assist (ASA) 2.0 suite becoming available on higher trims, offering features unusual in the budget sedan segment including Pre-Collision Warning, Pre-Collision Braking, Front Departure Alert, and Pedal Misoperation Control. Interior updates included revised upholstery patterns, updated instrument cluster, and improved infotainment options. Additional practical features were added including a built-in toll card reader on higher variants. The refreshed Bezza maintained its position as one of Malaysia's bestselling vehicles, appealing to budget-conscious buyers seeking the practicality of a sedan body style with improved safety technology, contemporary styling, and Perodua's reputation for reliability and low operating costs."
