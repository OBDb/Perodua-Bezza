    description: "The original Perodua Bezza was a significant milestone as Perodua's first sedan model, designed and developed primarily for the Malaysian market. Launched on 21 July 2016, it was built on the platform shared with the Axia hatchback but featured a four-door sedan body style. The design emphasized maximizing interior space and fuel efficiency, with Perodua claiming up to 95% local content. Powered by either a 1.0L three-cylinder 1KR-VE VVT-i engine producing 67 horsepower or a 1.3L four-cylinder 1NR-VE Dual VVT-i engine generating 94 horsepower, paired with either a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission. The interior prioritized practical features including multiple storage compartments, flexible 60:40 split-folding rear seats, and a spacious trunk. Available features included push-button start on higher trims, touchscreen infotainment with Bluetooth, reverse camera (Advance variant), and Vehicle Stability Control on the range-topping model. The Bezza achieved 5-star ASEAN NCAP safety rating for the Advance variant, with all models featuring dual airbags, ABS with EBD, and ISOFIX child seat anchors. This first generation positioned the Bezza as an affordable yet well-equipped entry-level sedan focused on value, fuel efficiency, and practicality for urban Malaysian families."

    description: "The refreshed Perodua Bezza received substantial styling updates while maintaining the same fundamental platform and dimensions. Launched in early January 2020, the facelift featured a redesigned front and rear bumper with gloss black finish on the rear chrome strip and side skirts, upgraded LED headlamps for all variants, and new 14-inch turbine design or 15-inch double-tone alloy wheels. Two new exterior colors were added: Garnet Red and Granite Grey. Interior updates included a revised speedometer with white illumination and removal of the pre-facelift's gloss black dashboard trim in favor of silver. The most significant update came in safety technology, with Perodua's Advanced Safety Assist (ASA) 2.0 suite becoming standard on the Advance variant, offering features unusual in the budget sedan segment including Pedestrian Detection, Pre-Collision Warning, Pre-Collision Braking, Front Departure Alert, and Pedal Misoperation Control. Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) was added to the Premium X variant. Mechanical specifications remained largely unchanged with the same 1.0L and 1.3L engine options, though the manual transmission was discontinued for 1.3L variants. The facelifted Bezza maintained its position as one of Malaysia's bestselling vehicles, with sales reaching 100,814 units in 2024 alone."
